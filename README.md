# Litta Larvae's Leafy Buffet
A 2D snake-style game about a hangry caterpillar turning into a butterfly, created during the 2025 [Level Her Up](https://levelherup.com.au/) Game Jam.

## Project Brief
The theme for this years' game jam was "Transformation". Our team worked together online and had 2 days to develop and present our game.

### Theme Concepts
We used a Canva whiteboard to brainstorm different transformation concepts such as cooking, building, aliens, and the metamorphosis of bugs. 

We then cast our votes and decided to create a game about the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly.

### Game Style
We used the same whiteboard to list different game-styles that we felt were simple enough to complete within the timeframe. We had discussions around the technical requirements for each style, ensuring there were no issues or concerns from a programming, art, or sound perspective to help with the shortlisting process.

With another vote we decided on a snake-style game where the objective was to move your caterpillar around the screen, eating as much as possible so that it can grow and transform.

### Game Play Design
After deciding on the overall concept and style we moved on to game mechanics, sorting out the components needed for a minimum viable product (MVP) from the stretch-goals. 

By the morning of day 2, we had achieved our MVP goals and were able to include one of our stretch goals - adding in an obstacle for the caterpillar to avoid, or lose some health on collision.
